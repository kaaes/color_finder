Mousless Color Picker
---------------------

Color picker that doesn't force you to use mouse (cause I friggin hate selecting single inputs!)

To operate with keyboard use tab to get to the element, then arrow keys to navigate. Press shift to move cursor faster.

Use letters to change the mode (rgb, hsl, hex) and cmd + c to copy it.

Hipster bonus
=============

It doesn't use any images - everything is generated with JS

To do
=====
* add alpha
* add 'copied' indicator
* add reverse mode - paste any color, translate it do other modes
